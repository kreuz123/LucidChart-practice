# Business Process Project: Overseas Purchasing Workflow

## Overview

This project showcases a workflow diagram created using Lucidchart during my first semester at Laurea University of Applied Sciences as part of the **Business Process** course. The workflow focuses on the **overseas purchasing process**, illustrating the current state and identifying potential areas for improvement.

## Objectives

- Understand the structure and flow of overseas purchasing activities.
- Apply project management principles to analyze and document business workflows.
- Identify opportunities to streamline and optimize processes based on visual representations.

## Tools Used

- **Lucidchart**: Used to design the workflow diagram and visualize the current state of the process.

## Key Learnings

1. **Workflow Planning**: Learned how to map and structure processes for better understanding and communication.
2. **Process Optimization**: Gained insights into identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies through diagramming.
3. **Practical Application**: Improved my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.

## Diagram Overview

The workflow diagram includes:

- Key steps in the overseas purchasing process.
- Roles and responsibilities of involved parties.
- Decision points and possible outcomes at each stage.
